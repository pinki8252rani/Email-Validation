# Email-Validation
This Project is a baased on email validation script. It checks whether a given email address meets certain criteria to be considered valid. The code takes an email address as input from the user.Three variables k, j, and d are initialized to zero. These will be used as flags to indicate specific errors in the email format.The email must be at least 6 characters long. If this condition fails, it prints "wrong Email 1".The first character of the email must be an alphabet letter. If this condition fails, it prints "wrong Email 2".The email must contain exactly one '@' character. If this condition fails, it prints "wrong Email 3".The email should end with a dot (.) that is either three or four characters from the end (e.g., .com or .in). The ^ operator is a bitwise XOR, ensuring that one and only one of these conditions is true. If this condition fails, it prints "wrong Email 4".The code iterates through each character in the email:
If the character is a space, k is set to 1.
If the character is an uppercase letter, j is set to 1.
If the character is a digit, underscore (_), period (.), or at sign (@), it continues without setting any flags.
If none of these conditions are met, d is set to 1, indicating the presence of an invalid character.
It checks for a basic email format that meets specific criteria such as length, starting with a letter, containing exactly one '@', ending correctly, and avoiding spaces, uppercase letters, or invalid characters. Note that the i==i.isspace() check is incorrect because i.isspace() is a method call returning True or False; this should simply be if i.isspace(). Additionally, Python's ^ operator should be used with caution in logical contexts, as it's typically used for bitwise operations.
